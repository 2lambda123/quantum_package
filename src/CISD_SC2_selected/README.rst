`cisd_sc2_selected <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/cisd_sc2_selection.irp.f#L1>`_
  Undocumented


`h_apply_pt2 <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L1253>`_
  Calls H_apply on the HF determinant and selects all connected single and double
  excitations (of the same symmetry). Auto-generated by the ``generate_h_apply`` script.


`h_apply_pt2_diexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L767>`_
  Generate all double excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.


`h_apply_pt2_en_sc2 <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L1946>`_
  Calls H_apply on the HF determinant and selects all connected single and double
  excitations (of the same symmetry). Auto-generated by the ``generate_h_apply`` script.


`h_apply_pt2_en_sc2_diexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L1460>`_
  Generate all double excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.


`h_apply_pt2_en_sc2_monoexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L1765>`_
  Generate all single excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.


`h_apply_pt2_monoexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L1072>`_
  Generate all single excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.


`h_apply_sc2_selected <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L521>`_
  Calls H_apply on the HF determinant and selects all connected single and double
  excitations (of the same symmetry). Auto-generated by the ``generate_h_apply`` script.


`h_apply_sc2_selected_diexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L1>`_
  Generate all double excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.


`h_apply_sc2_selected_monoexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CISD_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_17#L326>`_
